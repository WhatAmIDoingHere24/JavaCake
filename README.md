JavaCake is a Java GUI program built on the idea of TOR. JavaCakes allows users to host chat rooms to talk with one another. JavaCakes has a focus on security and privacy so all messages are encrypted and server host are allowed many options for security. Each Server must display a public key that any user can cross refrence with a known good keys table to amke sure that server is not a bad actor.
